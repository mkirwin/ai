===Flow Theory===

We like to do things that fit with our level of skill. There is a balance between challenge and boredom.

* Tutorials: trying to ease people to the 

"flow zone"
    1. challenging activity requiring skill
    2. a merging of action and awareness (muscle memory, extension of your mind)
    3. clear goals
    4. direct, immediate feedback > discernability: video games have direct, immediate feedback

    Results in
    - conentration
    - a sense of control
    - loss of self-consciousness
    - altered sense of time
