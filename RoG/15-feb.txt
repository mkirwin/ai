> Flow, Engagement, Immersion, & Presence

===Flow Theory===

We like to do things that fit with our level of skill. There is a balance between challenge and boredom.

* Tutorials: trying to ease people to the 

"flow zone"
    1. challenging activity requiring skill
    2. a merging of action and awareness (muscle memory, extension of your mind)
    3. clear goals
    4. direct, immediate feedback > discernability: video games have direct, immediate feedback

    Results in
    - conentration
    - a sense of control
    - loss of self-consciousness
    - altered sense of time

===Immersion Stages===
1. Engagement
barriers: access and invested time, effort, and attention

2. Engrossment
Middle level of involvement; wanting to keep playing and enter a 'zen-like' state
People start getting emotionally attached here
barriers: game construction > interesting story/landscape

3. Total Immersion
Presence, cut off from reality, forget the game is a game
Fleeting experience
barriers: empathy and atmosphere

===McMahan's Concept of Immersion and Presence===
Games are enjoyed at 2 levels:
- diegetic
- non-diegetic level

Immersion: "the sensatoin of being surrounded by a completely other reality"

Presence: often interchanged with immersion; the feeling of 'being there'

===Quality of Social Interaction===

===Realism===
- how accurately things are represented
    * social: how social interactions match the real world
    * perceptual: how closely depicted to real life things are

===Telepresence, Teleoperations, and Teleportation===
3 types of transportation > you are there, it is here, we are together

Telepresence: it is here and we are together; feeling present in the mediated environment
- video conference

Teleoperation: using tools to operate from afar

Teleportation: moving inside the media using maps or portals

===Perceptual and Psychological Immersion===
1. preceptual: blocking out sense from the outside world > removing lights, etc.
2. psychological: mental absorption into the world

===Social Actors===
* We respond to characters in games the same way we do in life.

===Intelligent Environment===
* Responding to a system as if it is real.
    - a system (AI) following social cues

=== Presence is Personal and Fleeting===
- games use different elements to invoke presence
- presence is subjective fur sur
- it is also tres fleeting
